Microsoft EXcel Data Analysis
Hi everyone,
Over the week, I did a data analysis on sales data to generate insights
Tool Used: Microsoft Excel
DATASET:
The dataset was from our cohort @quantum Analytics, Mr Jonathan after intensively training us on data analysis using excel, gave us some take home assignment. We were asked to generate a sales dashboard for Mr Wixsin Company and this was how I did mine.
The dataset provided had 4 different sheets: Location sheet had ranges Zip, State and Country.
Manufacturer sheet had ranges: Manufacturer ID and manufacturer name
Sales sheet had ranges: Product ID, Date, Zip, Unit, Revenue and Country.
Product Table had ranges: Product name, Category, Manufacturer ID, Product ID.
I converted the all the ranges into a tables.
I further to duplicate the sales table as this was my facts Table then proceeded to get the year, month and days column from the date column using the Text formula and concatenate other columns into the Salestable using the Index-Match formula.
DASHBOARD BUILDING:
I proceeded to create Pivot tables in a new sheet to display some major KPIs such as the Total Revenue, Number of managers, Daily and Monthly Revenue growth, Top 5 Products by Revenue, Revenue by each segment, Category contribution to Revenue and State contribution to Revenue.
These I display in their appropriate charts (Please see dashboard below)
I also included a month and segment slicer
RECOMMENDATIONS:
•	Ontario and British Columbia were the top revenue-generating states in 2015. As a result, increasing product availability in these areas could help further boost revenue.
•	The top 5 revenue generating product are products with IDs, 438, 506, 407, 487 and 401 and should always be made available.
•	Quebac and Manitoa are the least revenue generating states, marketing campaigns should be carried out in these states to create more brand awareness.
•	Mix, Youth and Rural categories are doing very poorly. The marketing team should come up with Ads that are targeted to these categories.
•	Products that fall under convenience and moderation segment can also be added as it is the most revenue generating segment.
